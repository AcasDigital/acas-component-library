## JavaScript

The JavaScript code will use standardjs (https://standardjs.com/) as a linting tool. This is to ensure that all developers current and future will use the same syntax, including naming methodology.

As an example, this includes:
* Indentation methodology (2 spaces)
* Single quotes for strings â€“ except to avoid escaping ('' instead of "")
* No unused variables
* No semicolons
* Space after keywords (for readability)
* Space after function name (for readability)
