# Work out how much holiday you should get

You’re entitled to paid holiday (also known as annual or statutory leave) if you work. How much you get depends on how many days you work and what arrangement you have with your employer.

You’re not entitled to paid holiday if you’re self-employed (run your own business).

## Your entitlement

You start to build up (or ‘accrue’) leave from the day you start working – even during a probationary period.

Your employer can choose to give you more holiday than your statutory entitlement. You’ll find out how much holiday you’ll get in your contract or written statement detailing the job.

### Full time

As a full-time worker you’re entitled to 5.6 weeks (28 days) paid holiday per year. Your employer can choose to give more leave than the legal minimum.

### Part time

You’re entitled to at least 5.6 weeks holiday pro-rata (in proportion to the hours you worked) if you work part time. For example, if you work 3 days a week, you’re entitled to 16.8 days leave.

### Irregular hours

If you work irregular hours, for example shift or casual work, you may need to use the [holiday entitlement calculator](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to work out how much holiday you should get.

> [Check your employment status](https://www.gov.uk/employment-status) if you’re not sure which of these apply to you.

## Calculate your holiday entitlement

You can calculate your [holiday entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) on GOV.UK.

You can base the calculation on:

* days or hours worked per week
* casual or irregular hours
* annualised hours – where you work a certain number of hours across the year but have some flexibility around which hours
* compressed hours – working full-time hours over fewer days
* shifts

## The leave year

Your company will have a start and finish date for calculating annual leave, for example 1 January to 31 December. You should be told the company’s ‘leave year’ when you start working.

If the leave year isn’t set out in the contract then it will start on the first day of a new job, or on 1 October (if started on or before 1 October 1998).

You must take your statutory leave during the leave year.

> There’s no automatic right to paid public or bank holidays. An employer can choose to include these as part of statutory annual leave.

## Limits on statutory leave

Annual leave entitlement is capped at 28 days – even if you work more than 5 days a week.

## Carrying over leave

Your contract will say how much leave you can ‘carry over’ (take in the next leave year) if you don’t take it.

You can carry over a maximum of 8 days out of 28 days’ leave. If you get more than 28 days’ leave it’s up to your employer to decide how many you can carry over.

An employer can restrict [when you can take your leave](Link to When you can take holiday from work page).

## Holiday when you’re leaving a job

You may be able to take the remainder of your annual leave during your [notice period] when you’re leaving a job.

How much you get depends on how far through the leave year you are. You can use the [holiday entitlement calculator](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to work this out.

Your employer must pay you for untaken statutory leave when you leave your job. This is known as ‘payment in lieu’.

### Taking more leave than your entitlement

If you’ve taken more holiday than your entitlement when your job ends, your employer can only take money from your final pay if agreed beforehand.

This ‘relevant agreement’ should be in your contract or in writing.

## Call the helpline
