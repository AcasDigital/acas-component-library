This is the Acas component library.

## What is the library?

This library hosts all of the components used to build the Acas digital innovation beta site.

The library is intended for internal Acas use, and can be used to create new templates and structures as the beta site is further developed.

## How to use the library

### Components
The components are separated into three separate folders:
* Global
  * For components that are used globally (on every page)
* Common
  * For components that are used on numerous pages
* Unique
  * For components that are used only on certain pages

### Structures

### Templates
