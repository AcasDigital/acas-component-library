# acas-component-library

This is the Acas component library.

## About the Library

### Tools and Design
The library is built on Fractal (http://www.fractal.build) and has been customised with a theme using the Acas digital brand guidelines. The theme can be found at its development location here: https://github.com/AcasDigital/acas-fractal-theme.

### Hosting Location:
The library is currently in development and is hosted at https://acas-component-library.herokuapp.com/.

## Local Installation

Download or fork the repository to use it locally.

### Dependencies
You will need to have NodeJS and NPM installed globally (https://nodejs.org/en/).

To install the necessary dependencies for the library, use the command line to enter the folder, e.g.

``` cd /Users/acas/acas-component-library/ ```

And then run ` npm install `.

### Running Fractal
When the dependencies have installed, you can run the library using `fractal start --sync` which will start the development server (default is http://localhost:3000/).

To build a static version of the site, run `fractal build`.
