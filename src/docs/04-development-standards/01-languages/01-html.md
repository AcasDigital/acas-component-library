##Â HTML5

HTML5 is the most up to date version of HTML, and included the introduction of semantic elements, such as:
* Header
* Footer
* Section
* Main
* Figure

To make the beta site semantic and readable, HTML5 will be used. This will require us to use plugins for backwards compatibility when working with legacy browsers - see 'Backwards Compatibility' for further details.

For more information on backwards compatibility, see <a href="../gds-guidelines/02-browser-compliance.md">
