title: Acas Design System
---
This is the Acas design system, built using Fractal (http://www.fractal.build).

## What is the design system?

This system hosts all of the components used to build the Acas Digital Brand. 
There are currently two services using the digital brand, the Acas Digital Advice public beta, and the Acas employment dispute private beta. 

This system is intended for internal Acas use, and can be utilised for the rapid prototyping or creation of new services as they are developed.

## How to use the system

### Component setup

The system hosts components inside individual folders.
When viewing a component, the HTML used to create the component is provided, alongside the SCSS (CSS3 compatible SASS - https://sass-lang.com/) used to style it.

The SCSS has been split down per component for use in the component library. 
To compile the SCSS into legible CSS for use with a new service, the full sets of SASS files including settings and helpers will need to be included. How to do this has been explained below:

### Acas front-end codebase

The design system uses the complete Acas front-end codebase to operate. The codebase has been installed as a dependency using NPM and can be viewed and downloaded here: (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@acas-digital-innovation/acas-frontend)
