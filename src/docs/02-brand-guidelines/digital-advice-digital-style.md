Acas Iconography is a common design pattern used in its visual language. We kept the line element and introduced it as a principal element of the digital brand in the header and titles.

The brand font is Century Gothic. We use the bold cut in the brand teal for all of the online titles. For content copy we use Open Sans.

A number of six colours make up the colour scheme for acas brand. We kept the primary two - lime and teal - and added the grey for the online designs.

Acas online platform hosts a vast amount of content, we advice avoiding unnecessary decoration, only use images if there’s a real user neeed.
