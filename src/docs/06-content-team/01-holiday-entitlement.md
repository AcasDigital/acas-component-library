# How much holiday you should get

You’re entitled to paid holiday (also known as annual or statutory leave) if you work. The amount of holiday you get depends on how many days or hours you work and what arrangement you have with your employer.

You’re not entitled to paid holiday if you’re self-employed (run your own business).

## Your entitlement

You start to build up (‘accrue’) leave from the day you start working – even during a probationary period.  

You continue to accrue holiday when you’re off sick and when on maternity, paternity or adoption leave.

Your employer can choose to give you more holiday than your statutory entitlement. Look in your contract or the written statement detailing your job to find out how much holiday you’ll get.

### Full time

As someone who works 5 (or more) days a week you’re usually entitled to 5.6 weeks (28 days) paid holiday per year. Your employer can choose to give more leave than the legal minimum.

### Part time

You’re entitled to at least 5.6 weeks holiday pro-rata (in proportion to the hours you worked) if you work part time. For example, if you work 3 days a week you’re entitled to 16.8 days’ leave.

### Irregular hours

If you work irregular hours, for example shift or casual work, you may need to use the [holiday entitlement calculator](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to work out how much holiday you should get.

## Calculate your holiday entitlement

You can use the [holiday entitlement calculator on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to work out how much holiday you should get.

Your calculation can be based on:

* days or hours worked per week
* casual or irregular hours
* annualised hours – where you work a certain number of hours across the year but have some flexibility around which hours
* compressed hours – working full-time hours over fewer days
* shifts

## The leave year

Your company will have a start and finish date for calculating annual leave (the ‘leave year’) for example, 1 January to 31 December. You should be told the company’s leave year when you start working.

If the leave year isn’t set out in your contract it will start on the first day of a new job, or on 1 October (if started on or before 1 October 1998).

You must take your statutory leave during the leave year.

> Keeping a written record of leave will help keep track of how much has been taken – for both employee and employer.

## Limits on statutory leave

Even if you work more than 5 days a week your statutory entitlement is only 28 days. Your employer could choose to give you more.

> There’s no automatic right to paid public or bank holidays. An employer can choose to include these as part of statutory annual leave.

## Carrying over leave

Your contract will say how much leave you can ‘carry over’ (take in the next leave year).

You can carry over a maximum of 8 days out of 28 days’ leave. If you get more than 28 days’ leave it’s up to your employer to decide how many you can carry over.

An employer can restrict [when you can take your leave](Link to When you can take holiday from work page).

## Holiday when starting a job

In the first year of a new job an employer can restrict holiday to how much you’ve accrued.

With this accrual system you’ll build up one twelfth of your leave each month, so that by the end of the third month you’ll be entitled to a quarter of your annual leave.

## Holiday when you’re leaving a job

You may be able to take the remainder of your annual leave during your [notice period] when you’re leaving a job.

How much you get depends on how far through the leave year you are when you finish your job. You can use the [holiday entitlement calculator](https://www.gov.uk/calculate-your-holiday-entitlement) to work this out.

Your employer must pay you for untaken statutory leave when you leave your job. This is known as ‘payment in lieu’.

### Taking more leave than your entitlement

If you’ve taken more holiday than your entitlement when your job ends, your employer can only take money from your final pay if agreed beforehand.
