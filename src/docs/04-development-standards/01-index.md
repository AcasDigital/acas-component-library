The development standards have been written to provide a clear guide on development methods and conventions for the Acas beta site.

This will help to ensure that all code is well formatted and coherent, even when there are numerous developers working on the project.

This section will cover our responsibilities as dictated by the GDS Service Manual, and how we meet best practise with each individual language used in development.
